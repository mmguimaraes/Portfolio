# SARIMA model applied to CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> data collected at Mauna Loa Observatory. 

SARIMA stands for Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Averages and it is a very useful technique applied to time series analysis, specially with the data presents seasonality.

We will take a look at the data collected at the Mauna Loa Observatory, in Hawaii, for two important Greenhouse gases: CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>. 

The data was retrieved from the Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) Global Monitoring Division website: <a href='https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/dv/data/index.php'>ESRL/GMD Data Finder.</a>
